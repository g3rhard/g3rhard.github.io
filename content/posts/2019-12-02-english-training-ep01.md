When I started training in gym, I want to increase my productivity level. And I found the way to do it: listening very useful podcasts in English.

The first podcats, which I listened is [The Big English Stand-up Show](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zb3VuZGNsb3VkLmNvbS91c2Vycy9zb3VuZGNsb3VkOnVzZXJzOjEzOTAwMjQ5L3NvdW5kcy5yc3M). I don't think that is very useful podcast, but in podcast people talk about thing, what happened everyday: about cars, weather, people, food and many, many other things. It is good practice for training listening english and do it with different people, different voices and various themes for talking.

The second podcast, which I listen regularly is [English in 10 minutes](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5ibHVicnJ5LmNvbS9mZWVkcy9lbmdsaXNoaW4xMG1pbnV0ZXMueG1s)
. In this podcasts people usually talk about cities, for example, in first 20 episodes talks about them. You can always hear something interesting and maybe you can feel, that you need to discover this cities. Ten minutes - not too much, to listen everyday, or maybe, on short training sessions. This podcasts also providing transcription of talks and worksheets on their website https://englishin10minutes.com.

The third podcast, which I listen (not) regularly is [The Daily](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5wb2R0cmFjLmNvbS96S3E2V1paTFRsYk0&ved=0CAQQrrcFahcKEwjY-5LQwdrnAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ). In this podcast you can listen stories, connected with news with various lenght - from ten to twenty-five minutes and may be more. It's simple - this is news podcasts, and if you don't want listen about cities or podcasts actors life - you can choose this podcast.

Anyway, you can choose any other podcasts, if you don't like this. You can find new podcasts in Soundcloud, Google Podcasts and even in [Yandex.Music](https://music.yandex.ru/users/yamusic-podcast/playlists/1000) (if you living in Russia or use VPN in Russia).

That's all.
