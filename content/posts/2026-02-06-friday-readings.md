🚀 Welcome to this week’s Friday Readings!

A quick collection of must‑reads, tool announcements, and tech highlights that caught my eye recently.

## 🛠️ Tools & Projects

* [Dockhand](https://dockhand.pro/) - A modern, local-first approach to container workflows, aiming to reduce Docker Compose sprawl and cognitive load.
* [Rekindle](https://rekindle.ink/) - A distraction-free reading environment for long-form content. A quiet rebellion against algorithmic feeds.
* [multiOTP](https://github.com/multiOTP/multiotp/wiki/) - A mature open-source OTP/MFA solution with solid fundamentals and zero marketing fluff.
* [PegaProx](https://github.com/PegaProx/project-pegaprox) - Proxy-centric experimentation around traffic control and interception, useful for labs and protocol analysis.
* [Oh My OpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) - A curated collection of OpenCode / AI tooling, scripts, and experiments worth exploring.

## 📚 Articles & Essays

* [A GDPR Failure](https://nikolak.com/gdpr-failure/) - A real-world post-mortem showing how compliance fails when process, ownership, and reality diverge.
* [21 Lessons Learned](https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/) - Career-scale reflections on engineering, leverage, and long-term thinking, distilled without guru theatrics.
* [Terraform vs Terragrunt](https://www.axelmendoza.com/posts/terraform-vs-terragrunt/) - A balanced comparison focused on trade-offs, not ideology. Especially useful for growing infra teams.
* [12 On-Call Dashboards That Calm Everyone Down](https://medium.com/@Modexa/12-on-call-dashboards-that-calm-everyone-down-e4aa8165fc56) - Observability through a human lens: fewer surprises, clearer signals, lower stress.

## 🔐 Security & Research

* [Notepad Hijacking by Lotus Blossom](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/02/notepad_hijacking_lotus_blossom/) - A reminder that “boring” binaries remain valuable targets, and persistence often hides in plain sight.
* [arXiv: 2601.19062](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19062) - Fresh research touching AI systems and reasoning. Dense, but rewarding if you enjoy first-principles thinking.

## 🎮 Culture & Light Reading

* [What Book You Should Read Based on Your Favorite Game](https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-what-book-you-should-read-based-on-your-favorite-game/2900-6540/) - A playful crossover between games and literature, surprisingly decent for inspiration.

Thanks for reading!

That’s all.
