As a system engineer, I have some apps which I use in my daily routine tasks in Windows environment. Some of them I use quite often, some of them just work in a background and let's started with description of these tools.

## FluentTerminal

I prefer FluentTerminal over Microsoft Terminal as it is more stable with my usual workflow. FluentTerminal is a customizable terminal emulator that supports tabs, split panes, and a range of different shells. I use it to work with Powershell on host system and for WSL.

## FancyWM

FancyWM is a tool that allows me to work efficiently without thinking too much about managing my apps. It is a dynamic tiling window manager that automatically resizes and arranges my open windows based on my preferences. With FancyWM, I can quickly switch between different apps, adjust the layout of my workspace, and focus on my work without distractions.

## MS PowerToys

MS PowerToys is a set of utilities that enhance the Windows experience, including features like keyboard shortcuts and advanced file management tools. Some of the PowerToys I use regularly include PowerToys Run, a quick launcher that lets me find and open files, apps, and settings with just a few keystrokes.

## Scoop

Scoop is a command-line package manager that allows you to easily install and manage Windows software. With Scoop, I can install tools and utilities like PowerShell, Node.js, and Git with just a few commands. Scoop also makes it easy to update and remove software, and it keeps my system clean by managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts.

## Nord themes

Nord is a color scheme that I use for my terminal and VS Code, providing a clean and minimalistic look. With Nord, I can quickly distinguish between different types of output, such as errors, warnings, and regular output. The color scheme also helps reduce eye strain and makes it easier to focus on my work.

## Vivaldi

Vivaldi is a highly customizable web browser that offers a range of features such as tab stacking and built-in note-taking. With Vivaldi, I can keep all of my work-related tabs organized and easily accessible. I also use the built-in RSS feature to get the latest updates from different sources (I hope I'll write about it later).

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux allows you to run Linux applications natively on Windows, making it easier for developers to work across different platforms. I use Windows Subsystem for Linux to run Ubuntu, which allows me to use Linux-based tools like sed, awk, and grep. This makes it much easier to work with a lot of tools, which are not exist in Windows (or their support very limited).

## Visual Studio Code

[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor that I use as a system engineer on Windows. It's a free, open-source app developed by Microsoft, and I find it to be useful for editing code, debugging, and managing projects. It has a wide range of features and extensions that make it highly customizable and efficient for my workflow.
