## TL;DR

Three real-life stories of DNS automation and CoreDNS hacks:

* Managing DNS zones via Git and CI/CD.
* Your own nip.io ‚Äî a service that auto-resolves IPs directly from the name.
* How to write your own CoreDNS plugin and integrate with Kubernetes.

## Story 1. Managing DNS Zones with Git

### The Challenge

* Multiple teams, each needing DNS records for test/staging environments.
* Changes must be safe (no ‚Äúoops, everything‚Äôs broken‚Äù scenarios).
* Administration should be simple, automated, and rollback-friendly.

### The Solution

**Using DNSControl**

* A handy tool for describing DNS zones as code.
* Format is close to RFC 1035.

**Sample configuration:**

```js
require("vars.js");

// Domains:
D('dso.domain.corp', REG_NONE, DnsProvider(BIND),
    A('@', '10.1.2.3'),
    A('ns1','10.1.2.4'),
    A('ns2','10.1.2.5')
);

// subzones
require("./subzones/poc.js");

// reverse zone
require("./revzones/rev-10-2-2.js");
```

**CI/CD pipeline for automation:**

```yaml
test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - dnscontrol check

build_job:
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - cp /etc/coredns/origins/* zones/
  script:
    - dnscontrol push
  after_script:
    - cp zones/*.zone /etc/coredns/origins/
```

* Validates config (`dnscontrol check`) before deployment.
* Any change can be rolled back via Git.
* Only certain admins have access to DNS management.

### Result

* Corporate users always have up-to-date DNS.
* Risks are minimized.
* Rollbacks are trivial.
* You can take the config and pipeline for your own use‚Äîsee the author's repo.

## Story 2. Your Own nip.io: Auto-DNS for IP Addresses

### The Problem

* For pilot deployments, getting DNS records approved takes too long.
* Need to resolve IPs from names (like nip.io), but:

  * Must work in isolated environments (no outside access).
  * Don‚Äôt want to depend on third-party services.

### The Solution

**Build your own nip.io**

* Use CoreDNS with the template plugin to parse IPs from FQDN.

**Example:**

```shell
dig 2025.devopsconf.ip-20-25-4-7.shturval.link @8.8.8.8

;; ANSWER SECTION:
2025.devopsconf.ip-20-25-4-7.shturval.link. 3600 IN A 20.25.4.7
```

**CoreDNS config:**

```caddyfile
shturval.link:53 {
    ready
    template IN A shturval.link {
        match ^\S+[.]ip-(?P<a>[0-9]*)-(?P<b>[0-9]*)-(?P<c>[0-9]*)-(?P<d>[0-9]*)[.]shturval[.]link[.]$
        answer "{{ .Name }} 3600 IN A {{ .Group.a }}.{{ .Group.b }}.{{ .Group.c }}.{{ .Group.d }}"
        fallthrough
    }
    rewrite stop type AAAA A
    rewrite stop type MX A
    rewrite stop type HTTPS A
    file /etc/coredns/shturval.link.zone
    cache 3600
    reload
    prometheus localhost:9253
}
```

* Deploy locally‚Äîeven in air-gapped environments.
* Simple template parsing of IPs from the domain name.
* Everything is powered by CoreDNS standard plugins.


## Story 3. How to Write Your Own CoreDNS Plugin

### The Backstory

* Platform upgrade caused node IPs to change.
* HAProxy was balancing traffic by static IPs ‚Üí ingress stopped working.
* Needed autodiscovery without access to load balancer configs.

### The Solution

* No need for Consul‚ÄîKubernetes + CoreDNS + etcd can do it!
* Write a CoreDNS plugin that watches pods and returns up-to-date IPs.

**How it works:**

* CoreDNS tracks pods with a specific annotation.
* On request‚Äîreturns all relevant IPs.
* HAProxy (or any LB) queries CoreDNS via a resolver and always gets fresh IPs.

**HAProxy config example:**

```haproxy
resolvers shturval-sht-capov
  nameserver ns1 api.shturval-sht-capov.domain.corp:1053
  accepted_payload_size 8192

backend ingress-https-shturval-sht-capov
  balance source
  mode tcp
  server-template ingress 3 default-nginx.ingress.shturval-sht-capov.coreha.shturval:30443 check resolvers shturval-sht-capov init-addr none
```

**Plugin skeleton (Go):**

```go
func init() {
    plugin.Register(pluginName, setup)
}

func setup(c *caddy.Controller) error {
    k, err := parse(c)
    if err != nil { /* ... */ }
    k.setWatch(context.Background())
    c.OnStartup(startWatch(k, dnsserver.GetConfig(c)))
    c.OnShutdown(stopWatch(k))
    dnsserver.GetConfig(c).AddPlugin(func(next plugin.Handler) plugin.Handler {
        k.Next = next
        return k
    })
    return nil
}

func (k *KubeHostport) ServeDNS(ctx context.Context, w dns.ResponseWriter, r *dns.Msg) (int, error) {
    // ... Build response, return current IPs ...
    writeResponse(w, r, records, nil, nil, dns.RcodeSuccess)
    return dns.RcodeSuccess, nil
}
```

* Code explanation:
  * Register and initialize the plugin via CoreDNS API.
  * Pod watcher‚Äîjust like `kubectl get --watch`.
  * Caches the list of IPs; hits kube-API only on changes.
  * You can literally write such a plugin in one evening‚Äîespecially with LLM help üòÑ

## Reflections & Takeaways

* CoreDNS is a powerful DevOps tool: flexible, extensible, minimal dependencies.
* 50+ in-tree plugins are officially supported.
* Making your own plugins and custom builds is truly simple.
* Code and examples are available in the author‚Äôs GitHub. Pull requests welcome!

## üí° Key Takeaways

* Treat your infrastructure as code (IaC)‚Äîeven DNS!
* Don‚Äôt be afraid to write your own plugins and automate your routine.
* CoreDNS is a fantastic tool for tricky DNS challenges.

That's all.
