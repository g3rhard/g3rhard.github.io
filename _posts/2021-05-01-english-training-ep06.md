Not so long time ago I finished read a book, which author received many awards and this book has a name "Embers of War".
It's a story about space ship, which has an AI. You can read this story, that written from a face of few characters, including the space ship. And like an other books in this genre (and maybe in a differents genres) - in the begining you can read and don't understand how all this characters is connected between but in the end all characters will be interact with each other.

I think this story can be interested for all people, who read space opera's - not a long book, not a deep canvas, you don't need to think about this world too much - just start read and enjoy the action inside.

That's all.
