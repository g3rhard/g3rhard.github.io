When I started training in gym, I want to increase my productivity level. And I found the way to do it: listening very useful podcasts in English.
I don't think that is very useful podcast, but in podcast people talk about thing, what happened everyday: about cars, weather, people, food and many, many other things.
It is good practice for training listening english and do it with different people, different voices and various themes for talking.

That's all.
