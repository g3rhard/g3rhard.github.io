Not long time ago I finished read the book from Google: [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html). This book is more theoretical, it describes various situations and how people doing in this situations. This book is more about culture, than about technical sides of work.

I found very interesting latest chapters ("Part V - Conclusions") of this book and also appendix, which can help to understand how to create work process in team.

That's all.
