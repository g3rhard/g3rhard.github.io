Not long time ago I started to read a new book in English. In the fact - it's old book for me, and I know this book mostly well. I started read this book, using audio records of reading by Steven Fry. He has good voice, and I can understand him. It's a book about adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Dr. John Watson. Now, without any doubts, it's a classic detective with very interesting description of people, places and cities. Reading this book is also good practice for improving reading skill. For now there are so many works about adventures of Sherlock Holmes and so many adaption of his story, but each one can be interesting, how it all started. We can see very colorful characters from Victorian England and you can feel yourself on a border of ages.

But in modern life this book cannot be very interesting but it's an example of good writing technic and you can imagine all, that was written in this book.

That's all.
