Like other people, I would like to announce my 2019 results. Some of my achievements not big for other people, but it is achievements for me. Let's started!

## Achievement of the year #1

I started training in the gym regularly. It is good idea - training in gym regularly, because hard training can clear your mind and remove bad thoughts. And it can increase your physical powers. Many scientist talk about training as positive factor for our mental health and I agree with them.

## Achievement of the year #2

I started learning Deutsch and finished, but after it, I started learning English again. Now, my progress can be faster, than before it.
I also start a subscription for useful Youtube channels which can help learn English and can do it more easy. And now I have a eye-wide for educational system, especially for learning foreigh language in school: almost cases it is boring and you can't remember any words or any rules, because you feel boring and you no interested with it. How can change it? I don't know, maybe combine english lessons with really interesting things, such as snowboarding ("hello, guys, let's go to flip") or MMO ("Today we going to Azherot and we will trying to farm something for your teacher!")?

## Achievment of the year #3

I was in many new places and cities:
* Berlin (Germany)
* Krakow (Poland)
* Liberec (Czesh Republic)
* And more other cities...
I liked all places where I was with my wife. It's a new experience - exploring new places, trying to understand different languages and culture. Sometimes it can be hard, but in the same time it can be fun. Trying new food, using different types of transport - all this is very interesting.

I think, here can be more my achievements, but...

That's all.
