ShellCheck - is a new tools for me, which can help to debug and beauty my shell scripts. Only today I refactored my backup script, using hints in VSCode.
This tool have big documentation with explanation, why you must check and fix your code. This is a useful utility that everyone needs in his environment.

Simple install (in MacOS):

```sh
brew install shellcheck
```

You can also install plugin for Visual Studio Code:

```sh
code --install-extension timonwong.shellcheck
```

This plugin also support run from WSL.

That's all.
